The open ocean is unimaginably immense - it covers more than 360 million square kilometres of the Earths surface. Much of this huge expanse of seawater is marine desert with virtually no sign of life. Yet the fastest and most powerful survive, playing a deadly game of hide-and-seek with their prey. This charts how they track down prey in the seemingly featureless seas, following the extraordinary life of yellowfin tuna from a minute egg to a 200 kilogram, voracious predatory giant.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

In the Arctic the polar bear is the top predator, catching seals on the ice and forcing seabirds to nest high up on cliffs. In Antarctica the flightless penguins have no ground-based predators to deal with but lurking in the water is the constant threat from leopard seals.

Dopo il funerale, Luca chiede ad Emma ed Enrico di nasconderlo fino a quando riuscira a dimostrare la propria innocenza. Intanto, messo alle strette, Fontana confessa ad Enrico ed Emma di aver "comprato" Martina: ma non ha ucciso Luigi e non sa se Martina sia Alice. Intanto Davide e Luisa si sposano; poco dopo Luca si presenta in commissariato, ed emerge la verita sul ritorno della Conti a Vicenza. Oltre a Luisa anche suo marito Davide scopre tutto, sgomento e deluso: Alice e anche sua figlia! Anche in famiglia, Emma assiste alla reazione accesa del fratello Roberto e poi a quella delle sue ragazze: ora sanno di essere state scelte solo per la storia della loro nascita. La Conti pero adesso crede in loro: presenteranno la loro coreografia al Festival. Ora Emma vuole solo abbandonarsi allamore di Enrico ma riceve una telefonata che la turba.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num></programme>

Luomo è stato rinvenuto nella piscina, legato alla sua sedia. Il suo ufficio è stato ricostruito in modo tanto inquietante quanto preciso. Un quadro macabro che porta Malcolm a convincersi che il colpevole non potrebbe essere che un allievo dellistituto. Attraverso un primo flashback, torniamo al 2005. Malcolm, in visita al padre, annuncia di voler aprire un nuovo capitolo, cambiare qualcosa, lasciarsi alle spalle il passato: cambierà il suo cognome, non vuole essere riconosciuto come il figlio del Chirurgo, dora in avanti non sarà più Malcolm Whitly, ma Malcolm Bright.Torniamo al presente. Malcolm e Gil incontrano il professor Delaney, preside ad interim e scoprono che Jessica ha assicurato al consiglio direttivo della scuola che le indagini si svolgeranno nella massima discrezione. I due rimangono sorpresi, ancor più sorpresi quando Jessica si presenta di fronte a loro, considerando anche la situazione delicata venutasi a creare tra la donna e Gil. Nel frattempo, Martin diventa sempre più complice con Pete (guest star Christian Borle) e JT comincia a capire cosa comporti limminente paternità.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

The man fronting the group was Mick Hucknall. His distinctive soul tone saw some regard him as one of the voices of his generation. Simply Red would find global success with a revision of a song Hucknall wrote whilst in the Frantic Elevators. Upon its second release in 1986, ‘Holding Back the Years’ notably reached number one on the US Billboard Charts. By 1991, Simply Red were a global success story; after a two year wait they released the much anticipated single, ‘Something Got Me Started’ which showed a new direction for the band. In 2005 Simply Red released the album, ‘Stay’. It would be Mick Hucknall’s last recording under the group name.

Featuring vocalist Chuck Billy, guitar virtuosos Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick, bassist Greg Christian, and original drummer Louie Clemente (along with Testament and White Zombie alumnus John Tempesta as a second drummer), the band rips through classic Testament fan favorites in this show, shot in London earlier in 2005.Among the leaders of heavy metal over the past twenty years, Testament have always provided the rock solid proof that great song writing, regardless of genre, will always transcend time. Their crucial contributions to the early thrash metal surge of the mid to late 1980s helped to develop a sound that forever changed the face of heavy music and resonates just as loudly today. With all of their Bay Area peers either calling it a day or drastically altering their sound, Testament has remained a worldwide metal ambassador throughout the 1990s and into the new century.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2024..</episode-num></programme>

Nishio si infortuna e al suo posto entra Ishizaki, il quale senza volerlo commette autogoal e fa passare in vantaggio lHanawa. A differenza di questultima, la Nankatsu deve per forza vincere la partita con un punto di vantaggio per accedere alla fase finale; un pareggio non sarebbe sufficiente. Con laiuto di Misaki, Ishizaki riesce a pareggiare rimediando cosi allerrore commesso prima.

Mentre proseguono le ricerche dei corpi nel luogo dellesplosione, Luca deve comunque risolvere un caso complesso. Il giornalista Cosimo Notari è caduto vittima di una chiara esecuzione mafiosa. In un video-messaggio, lo stesso Notari accusa della propria morte il costruttore Francesco Lomartire, su cui indagava da tempo per supposte infiltrazioni mafiose.

Luca Benvenuto riesce a venire a capo del caso del giornalista, scoprendo che dietro alla sua morte si cela in realtà una vendetta a lungo meditata: il costruttore Favaro ha costretto il giornalista ad accusare Lomartire e poi lo ha fatto uccidere per far ricadere la colpa sullavversario, colpevole di avergli soffiato un grosso affare, anni prima, grazie alle sue conoscenze mafiose.

Sitting idle for over 60 years , the building is badly rundown, and several of its windows are broken . From the outside, it looks as if the building has been looted and vandalized , but the team steps into a place that is packed with objects. In fact, it looks as if time simply stopped back in 1957, when the mill shut down . In every room, they find items that help piece together the story of both the factory and its workers - Records reveal earnings were as low as 20 cents an hour , and employees were mainly women and young people. And the building is filled with things that the team can salvage. Antique light fixtures, old fire equipment , and a vintage water fountain are just a few of the pieces Jay is eager to restore. Saddened to see how time is taking its toll on the aging factory, he hopes to remove these historic items before theyre completely destroyed by decay . But the owner is fiercely attached to the mill and seems unwilling to let anything ago . Jay must somehow convince him that its finally time to sell and to give these objects a new life, before its too late .</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

Il difficile ambiente di Trastevere degli anni Settanta è stato il primo avversario di Giordano, sconfitto grazie alla sua passione per il pallone e grazie a Don Pizzi, un prete che, oltre a tenerlo lontano dalla strada, gli procura a 13 anni il primo provino per la Lazio. Giordano si guadagna così loccasione di iniziare a giocare con i campioni dItalia del 1974: la Lazio di Maestrelli allenatore, di Wilson capitano, di Chinaglia, Martini, Pulici e Re Cecconi. Il 23 marzo 1980, dopo una stagione da capocannoniere con una convocazione praticamente certa per lEuropeo, Giordano viene arrestato insieme ad altri suoi compagni di squadra nel primo importante scandalo del calcioscommesse. Giordano grida a gran voce la sua innocenza. La condanna inflitta al termine del processo sportivo è pesantissima: tre anni e sei mesi di squalifica che gli faranno saltare, oltre allEuropeo del 1980 e a due stagioni di campionato. Tra gli intervistati Lionello Manfredonia, che ha giocato nella Lazio dal 1975 al 1985, condividendo con Giordano lesperienza in campionato, gli anni nelle giovanili della Lazio e la squalifica per lo scandalo del calcioscommesse; Andrea Carnevale, che viene acquistato dal Napoli nel 1986 e nella stagione dello scudetto 1986-1987 forma insieme a Maradona e Giordano il trio dattacco del Napoli; Riccardo Cucchi, storico giornalista e radiocronista Rai, nonche grande tifoso della Lazio.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2023..</episode-num></programme>

Raffaele Cadorna fu antifascista dallinizio, e per questo inviso al regime che cercò sempre di non valorizzarlo, ma neppure pote impedire che, diventato generale di brigata e poi di divisione, avesse comandi prestigiosi come il Savoia cavalleria di Milano, la Scuola di cavalleria di Pinerolo, la divisione corazzata Ariete. Al comando della divisione Ariete, lindomani dellotto settembre 1943 fronteggiò vittoriosamente i tedeschi a Nord di Roma. Subito dopo, entrato in clandestinità, fu esponente della Resistenza nella Capitale. Nellestate 1944 venne scelto come comandante militare della Resistenza al Nord e nellagosto fu paracadutato in Lombardia. Rappresentò un nevralgico punto di incontro tra Resistenza, Governo dellItalia liberata e Alleati, ed ebbe un ruolo decisivo nelle drammatiche ore del 25 aprile 1945 e della esecuzione di Mussolini.

Il ricordo degli anni della giovinezza e il desiderio di rivivere quelle emozioni accompagna la scrittrice e il suo compagno di viaggio tra i vicoli del centro storico, fino a raggiungere la vecchia libreria universitaria che Simonetta frequentava da studentessa. Costruita allinterno di un campanile e tutta sviluppata in altezza, è un posto unico e fra le librerie più piccole al mondo. A Palermo Simonetta incontra poi un suo grande amico dai tempi delluniversità, Rino Messina, ex Presidente del Tribunale Militare di Palermo. Insieme visitano il Palazzo della Zisa, antica dimora dei re normanni, in cui sono visibili i segni delle varie influenze su Palermo, compresa quella araba. Dalla parola "al-Aziz", ovvero "splendido", deriva il nome Zisa. Intanto Massimo ne approfitta per lanciarsi da solo alla scoperta della città e si avventura alla ricerca del tipico street food palermitano. Dopo aver esplorato il quartiere arabo della Kalsa, raggiunge il meraviglioso orto botanico della città e tra piante uniche al mondo inizia a disegnare. Il tour palermitano prosegue con Piazza Pretoria e la Chiesa e Monastero di Santa Caterina dAlessandria: ad accompagnarli è Amelia Crisantino, cultrice di storia della Sicilia, che racconta curiosità e aneddoti della vita delle monache di clausura. Nel chiostro del monastero Simonetta e Massimo degustano i dolci preparati nella pasticceria interna, secondo le antiche ricette delle suore. Prima di lasciare Palermo, Simonetta vuole salutare un altro suo caro amico, il maestro puparo Mimmo Cuticchio, la cui arte è stata riconosciuta dallUnesco Patrimonio dellUmanità.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2022.1.</episode-num></programme>

Ma cè spazio anche per lorgoglio di una grande opera pubblica, quando Milano e Napoli vengono collegate dallAutostrada del Sole, completata in otto anni. A ottobre si svolgono le Olimpiadi di Tokyo, viste per la prima volta in diretta televisiva in tutto il mondo tramite satelliti artificiali, ricordate da uno degli azzurri che vi hanno partecipato, la medaglia doro nei 50 chilometri di marcia Abdon Pamich.

Il ricordo degli anni della giovinezza e il desiderio di rivivere quelle emozioni accompagna la scrittrice e il suo compagno di viaggio tra i vicoli del centro storico, fino a raggiungere la vecchia libreria universitaria che Simonetta frequentava da studentessa. Costruita allinterno di un campanile e tutta sviluppata in altezza, è un posto unico e fra le librerie più piccole al mondo. A Palermo Simonetta incontra poi un suo grande amico dai tempi delluniversità, Rino Messina, ex Presidente del Tribunale Militare di Palermo. Insieme visitano il Palazzo della Zisa, antica dimora dei re normanni, in cui sono visibili i segni delle varie influenze su Palermo, compresa quella araba. Dalla parola "al-Aziz", ovvero "splendido", deriva il nome Zisa. Intanto Massimo ne approfitta per lanciarsi da solo alla scoperta della città e si avventura alla ricerca del tipico street food palermitano. Dopo aver esplorato il quartiere arabo della Kalsa, raggiunge il meraviglioso orto botanico della città e tra piante uniche al mondo inizia a disegnare. Il tour palermitano prosegue con Piazza Pretoria e la Chiesa e Monastero di Santa Caterina dAlessandria: ad accompagnarli è Amelia Crisantino, cultrice di storia della Sicilia, che racconta curiosità e aneddoti della vita delle monache di clausura. Nel chiostro del monastero Simonetta e Massimo degustano i dolci preparati nella pasticceria interna, secondo le antiche ricette delle suore. Prima di lasciare Palermo, Simonetta vuole salutare un altro suo caro amico, il maestro puparo Mimmo Cuticchio, la cui arte è stata riconosciuta dallUnesco Patrimonio dellUmanità.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2022.1.</episode-num></programme>

Arriva l8 settembre 1943, con il conseguente disfacimento delle forze armate italiane. Il giorno dopo, nella confusione generale, Bellomo si rende protagonista di unazione eroica. Alla guida di un nucleo di militari si oppone ai tedeschi che vogliono distruggere il porto di Bari, prima di abbandonare la città. La sua azione permetterà di consegnare agli alleati, che arrivano a Bari qualche giorno dopo, una città libera e con le infrastrutture intatte. Ma il 28 gennaio 1944 Bellomo viene arrestato dai militari inglesi con laccusa di aver compiuto un crimine di guerra. Lepisodio risale al 30 novembre 1941, quando il generale ordina di sparare a due ufficiali inglesi che tentano di fuggire da un campo di prigionia. La situazione è confusa, come pure la dinamica dei fatti. Un prigioniero rimane ucciso, laltro ferito. Il processo, che inizia il 23 luglio 1945, è il primo in Europa contro un presunto criminale di guerra. Si svolge nella quasi totale assenza di garanzie per limputato. Il generale è accusato di aver fatto uccidere a freddo i due uomini e viene condannato a morte. Unico ufficiale italiano ad essere giustiziato per crimini di guerra, Bellomo nel 1951 riceverà la medaglia dargento al valor militare per lazione al porto di Bari.

Protagonisti dello spettacolo dagli anni 40, hanno esordito proprio in radio e in questa puntata ripropongono alcuni dei loro successi, come "Il visconte di Castelfombrone" e "Sole, pizza e amore". È il turno dellattore Carlo Dapporto, uno dei protagonisti della "rivista" teatrale italiana, che si produce in sketch dannata. Con Aldo Salvo, giornalista di lungo corso e firma del documentario radiofonico, si parla della lunga tradizione dei radiodocumentari, che affonda le radici al dopoguerra: viene presentato un brano de "La luna nel pozzo" del 1950, registrato in una casa di cure psichiatriche e il più noto di questi titoli, "Clausura" di Sergio Zavoli, Premio Italia 1958 (Sergio Zavoli, in quel 1984, è presidente della Rai). La puntata si avvia alla conclusione con due voci degli anni 50 che cantano alcuni loro successi, Luciano Tajoli e Nilla Pizzi, vincitrice dei primi due Festival di Sanremo e per questo conosciuta da tutti come "la regina della canzone", indossando ironicamente una corona, mentre festeggiano la carriera di Tajoli. Il congedo di "Cari amici", tra cori "da stadio", si consuma con arbore e "I Senza vergogna" che cantano in coro "O surdato nnammurato ("Ohi vita, ohi vita mia…") insieme a un grande interprete della canzone napoletana, animatore di tanti programmi da Radio Napoli, Roberto Murolo.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2024.8.</episode-num></programme>

Obwohl auf den Mann ein wahrer Kugelhagel niedergeht, bleibt er unverletzt. Das Merkwurdige daran ist die Munition, die keinerlei Riefungen aufweist. Walter findet die dazugehorige Waffe, und mit Hilfe einer DNS-Spur wird auch der Schutze gefunden: Es handelt sich um Dario, ein Gang-Mitglied. Brad wird in Schutzgewahrsam genommen, ist aber auch im Gebaude des CSI nicht sicher. Von der gegenuberliegenden Station Brickell werden Schusse auf ihn abgefeuert. Auch diesmal sind an den Projektilen keine Riefungen zu erkennen. Bei der Durchsuchung des Bahnhofs finden die Ermittler die Überreste eines selbstgebauten Gewehres. Shane, der schon als Zeuge beim ersten Anschlag auf Brad in Erscheinung trat, hat Verbrennungen an den Unterarmen, die Horatio als von der selbstgebastelten Waffe verursacht, identifiziert. Frank findet heraus, dass das einzige Verbindungsglied zwischen Dario und Shane der Bewahrungshelfer Neil ist. Und tatsachlich scheint Neil gute Motive zu haben, dem Buchmacher den Tod zu wunschen.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">8.6.</episode-num></programme>
