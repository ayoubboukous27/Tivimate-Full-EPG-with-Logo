Through his auspices, she is introduced to bohemian Paris where her creative appetite is sparked.

The phenomenal success of her "Claudine" series makes Willy well known as a writer and Colette and Willy the first modern celebrity couple.

None of the men had any idea what awaited them on the other side. No one knows why they defected, until now. Each man left his Southern border post in the demilitarised zone - the DMZ, a 2.5 mile wide patch of land that splits the Korean peninsula in half and is the most heavily fortified area on earth, packed with 2.5m land mines-and walked into an alien world. Dresnok and his unique band of brothers published propaganda pamphlets, telling the world how happy they were in the Peoples Paradise and starred in propaganda films, vilifying US servicemen. They became North Korean national heroes. The world knows of only one of these men: Charles Robert Jenkins. His story broke open in September 2002 when it was reported that one of the kidnapped Japanese nationals, Hitomi Soga, had married an American defector. What no one knew at that time, except for the filmmakers, was that a second American defector, James Joseph Dresnok, was alive. Jenkins now lives in Japan with his wife and daughters. He is a key part of the story but as much of it is now in the public domain, it is Dresnok who is the driving force of the film. Dresnok remains in North Korea and lives with his family in the capital city, Pyongyang, and has not had contact with outsiders since his defection in 1962. Dresnok grew up a poor orphan in Virginia, and never finished high school. He had little choice but go to the army when after a first stint in West Germany, he was sent over to the most dangerous border in the world, the DMZ. Dresnok has now lived for 44 years in Pyongyang, capital city of North Korea, one of the most deeply anti-American societies in the world. He worked for the Korean Peoples Army as an English teacher, learned the language and the system. For the first time, Dresnok tells his story.</desc></programme>

None of the men had any idea what awaited them on the other side. No one knows why they defected, until now. Each man left his Southern border post in the demilitarised zone - the DMZ, a 2.5 mile wide patch of land that splits the Korean peninsula in half and is the most heavily fortified area on earth, packed with 2.5m land mines-and walked into an alien world. Dresnok and his unique band of brothers published propaganda pamphlets, telling the world how happy they were in the Peoples Paradise and starred in propaganda films, vilifying US servicemen. They became North Korean national heroes. The world knows of only one of these men: Charles Robert Jenkins. His story broke open in September 2002 when it was reported that one of the kidnapped Japanese nationals, Hitomi Soga, had married an American defector. What no one knew at that time, except for the filmmakers, was that a second American defector, James Joseph Dresnok, was alive. Jenkins now lives in Japan with his wife and daughters. He is a key part of the story but as much of it is now in the public domain, it is Dresnok who is the driving force of the film. Dresnok remains in North Korea and lives with his family in the capital city, Pyongyang, and has not had contact with outsiders since his defection in 1962. Dresnok grew up a poor orphan in Virginia, and never finished high school. He had little choice but go to the army when after a first stint in West Germany, he was sent over to the most dangerous border in the world, the DMZ. Dresnok has now lived for 44 years in Pyongyang, capital city of North Korea, one of the most deeply anti-American societies in the world. He worked for the Korean Peoples Army as an English teacher, learned the language and the system. For the first time, Dresnok tells his story.</desc></programme>

The front office of the Atlanta Braves is starting to question his judgement, especially with the countrys hottest batting phenom on deck for the draft.

Truckers in the worlds most dangerous tundras carry vital equipment to remote outposts located hundreds of miles north of civilisation and all the roads are temporarily created by frozen bodies of water. The mission is to transport thousands of loads before the road literally disappears into the sea. Like their trailblazing forefathers, these truckers continue to carry on the lone wolf entrepreneurial spirit that built America, taking huge risks in the hopes of receiving huge rewards. Continuing this groundbreaking series, our truckers will once again embark on a race against the elements, against time and against each other. The series will continue to examine this time honoured profession that dates back almost a century, often through generations of families.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.6.</episode-num></programme>

Continuing this groundbreaking series, our truckers will once again embark on a race against the elements, against time and against each other. The series will continue to examine this time honoured profession that dates back almost a century, often through generations of families.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.5.</episode-num></programme>

They sample some great food, visit well known sites, and experience fun activities such as white water rafting and indoor skydiving. Most importantly, they meet a host of extraordinary women, young and old, and talk about identity, purpose, relationships, beauty, choices, and much more. Throughout their travels, Jeni and Sarah will have fun, but they will always bring each episode back to one central theme: teaching young ladies about Gods grace in their lives and addressing relevant issues in a redemptive way. Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary is different than other youth-oriented reality TV for many reasons and will stand out as a positive, biblically-based alternative to many of the secular reality shows that depict todays youth in a negative light. It offers another option for reality TV fans that love the genre but are turned off by the reckless behaviour and non-existent values system of most secular reality-based programming. In a time when immorality, irreverence, and confusion have become ordinary, Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary will always take the high road to the extraordinary.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.7.</episode-num></programme>

Consequently, neural pathways develop which then influence the individual to use again. Jared Cookes story depicts how his past addiction led him down a dark path where he would do anything for his next fix jeopardising important relationships. Cheating, lying and stealing along the way he finally landed in prison. His recovery and redemption beautifully demonstrates how one can overcome these learned and highly reinforcing behaviours through a willingness to do the work and humbly accepting help.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.7.</episode-num></programme>

He was the first politician to be assassinated in Australia. For many years, Newman had been waging a campaign to break up the Asian crime gangs and corruption that had plagued the area. He had been the target of numerous death threats from such gangs but did not seek police protection. During the night of September 5, 1994, while outside his Woods Avenue home, he was shot and killed. His fiancee, Lucy Wang, was with him at the time but saw little of what happened because of the swiftness of the murder. A local nightclub owner, Phuong Ngo, who had previously attempted to secure Labor Party preselection for the seat, was convicted of the killing in 2001. Two of Ngos associates escaped convictions.

This program returns you to the crime scene so you can examine all the clues for yourself. Can you piece together the facts and eventually crack the case? Combining the thrill of a mystery with the visceral experience of true crime drama, "Cold Blood" navigates the confounding twists and turns on the journey to solving a homicide. As competing theories come to light, this program explores how the crime could have occurred from each perspective. Experience real investigations as they unfold. Follow the forensics as it reveals the truth. When a work crew uncovers a young womans skull on a stretch of Florida highway, investigators try to determine who she is and find her killer. They refer to her as "Jane Doe I-275" after the interstate where she was found. But strangely, her remains dont match up to any of the available databases. And none of the reported missing persons cases match the remains found in Pinellas County. As the case grows cold in Florida, a bizarre discovery surfaces more than a 1600km away. Among the 100 or so disturbing images found in a sealed envelope in Kansas are a series of gruesome photos depicting a brutally beaten and possibly dead young woman with obvious tan lines. It may be just the lead Florida detectives are looking for but it will take months before they reach the Sunshine State, and even longer before the grisly story of what happened to a shy teen turned stripper is revealed.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.2.</episode-num></programme>

During the night of September 5, 1994, while outside his Woods Avenue home, he was shot and killed. His fiancee, Lucy Wang, was with him at the time but saw little of what happened because of the swiftness of the murder. A local nightclub owner, Phuong Ngo, who had previously attempted to secure Labor Party preselection for the seat, was convicted of the killing in 2001. Two of Ngos associates escaped convictions.

This program returns you to the crime scene so you can examine all the clues for yourself. Can you piece together the facts and eventually crack the case? Combining the thrill of a mystery with the visceral experience of true crime drama, "Cold Blood" navigates the confounding twists and turns on the journey to solving a homicide. As competing theories come to light, this program explores how the crime could have occurred from each perspective. Experience real investigations as they unfold. Follow the forensics as it reveals the truth. When a work crew uncovers a young womans skull on a stretch of Florida highway, investigators try to determine who she is and find her killer. They refer to her as "Jane Doe I-275" after the interstate where she was found. But strangely, her remains dont match up to any of the available databases. And none of the reported missing persons cases match the remains found in Pinellas County. As the case grows cold in Florida, a bizarre discovery surfaces more than a 1600km away. Among the 100 or so disturbing images found in a sealed envelope in Kansas are a series of gruesome photos depicting a brutally beaten and possibly dead young woman with obvious tan lines. It may be just the lead Florida detectives are looking for but it will take months before they reach the Sunshine State, and even longer before the grisly story of what happened to a shy teen turned stripper is revealed.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.2.</episode-num></programme>

Its the twenty-first century but it could be the 1930s. The election successes of the neo-Nazi parties in Europe reveal that voters are hungry again for populist politicians who express their anger towards failing governments; but do people really want an authoritarian, nationalist government in power? The Rise of the Nazi Party reveals how the National Socialists exploited the economic turmoil of their time, rose to power in Germany in 1933 and then led their nation into a nightmare of brutality, genocide and military defeat. This documentary series tells the true story of the rise of the Nazis through archive film footage, interviews and dramatic reconstructions and carries on the chilling story after the war to chart the current rise of the neo-Nazis.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num></programme>

Its the twenty-first century but it could be the 1930s. The election successes of the neo-Nazi parties in Europe reveal that voters are hungry again for populist politicians who express their anger towards failing governments; but do people really want an authoritarian, nationalist government in power? The Rise of the Nazi Party reveals how the National Socialists exploited the economic turmoil of their time, rose to power in Germany in 1933 and then led their nation into a nightmare of brutality, genocide and military defeat. This documentary series tells the true story of the rise of the Nazis through archive film footage, interviews and dramatic reconstructions and carries on the chilling story after the war to chart the current rise of the neo-Nazis.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num></programme>

The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tims father tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim cant change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life - so he decides to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary. They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means hes never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. But as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds out that his unique gift cant save him from the sorrows and ups and downs that affect all families, everywhere. There are great limits to what time travel can achieve, and it can be dangerous too. This is a comedy about love and time travel, which discovers that, in the end, making the most of life may not need time travel at all.</desc></programme>

The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tims father tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim cant change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life - so he decides to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary. They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means hes never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. But as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds out that his unique gift cant save him from the sorrows and ups and downs that affect all families, everywhere. There are great limits to what time travel can achieve, and it can be dangerous too. This is a comedy about love and time travel, which discovers that, in the end, making the most of life may not need time travel at all.</desc></programme>
