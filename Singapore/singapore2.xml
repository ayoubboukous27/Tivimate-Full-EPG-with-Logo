Years have passed since Yoke and Ella had their lives turned upside-down when they returned to be with their rightful families after having been swapped at birth. Years later, Yoke has seemingly embraced her role as a status-conscious, high society Shelley, assuming a leadership role in the family business. Ella has accepted her fate as a member of the salt of the earth, working-class Loh family but struggles to make something of her life.

Years have passed since Yoke and Ella had their lives turned upside-down when they returned to be with their rightful families after having been swapped at birth. Years later, Yoke has seemingly embraced her role as a status-conscious, high society Shelley, assuming a leadership role in the family business. Ella has accepted her fate as a member of the salt of the earth, working-class Loh family but struggles to make something of her life. Has the nature vs nurture battle run its course or are relationships between the families still as fraught and complicated as ever? The Lohs, Shelleys, Hassans, and Balas have overcome personal loss, incarceration, as well as estrangement of their loved ones; yet lingering tensions remain. Mysteries continue to unfold as characters pursue their individual agendas, while emotional drama abounds as surprising twists are revealed that threaten the stability to which they have become accustomed..</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.203.</episode-num></programme>

A total of 12 to 15 singers are invited to serve as music partners, and they will sing in pairs on their own. After each round of performance, the members will jointly select among the songs that have been sung. The partners who finally get the recommended hits will serve as the captains of the next episode and lead the three pairs of singers to perform and compete for the title of golden song. 季赛制与前三季不同，共邀请十二至十五位歌手担任音乐合伙人，并由他们自行进行两两配对演唱；如果合伙人数量为单数，则最终会有一名歌手在该集节目轮空。在每轮歌曲演唱后，声音鉴赏团成员会在已演唱的歌曲中共同选出目前的待定金曲，最终获得推荐金曲的搭档将分别担任下一期的队长，带领本队的三对歌手进行歌曲表演并角逐金曲称号。从第二阶段起，每期均会由在场观看录制的两百位观众额外选出一首人气金曲。</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.8.</episode-num></programme>

Now, a team of scientists and locals are racing against time to bring them back. This is the untold story of Nesha Ichida, a marine biologist leading a groundbreaking effort to rewild leopard sharks in their native waters. Her mission begins with Myra, a pup shark, whose survival depends on Neshas ability to teach her the harsh ways of the wild. Myra will struggle to hunt, compete with other predators, and navigate the wild waters she was born to inhabit. Meanwhile, Nesha faces her own battle: combating the illegal fishing that continues to ravage Indonesias oceans. As the fight for survival intensifies, an unexpected bond forms between scientist and shark---a bond that blurs the lines between human and animal, between hope and despair, as both Nesha and Myra embark on a journey to find their way back to the wild.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

And chances are, you had no idea. Unassuming yet effective, nudges are everywhere. They are peppered in the aisles of grocery stores, and trap us in bottomless doom scrollings on our phones. These gentle manipulators influence our every decision - thats a whopping 35,000 decisions each day! This 5-part series uncovers the invisible forces behind our choices through the lens of some of our most long drawn struggles. What are ways we are being nudged through our screens? With all the pizzas stacked against us, how can we eat and live healthier in a world of irresistible junk food? Can the artful wielding of words drive people to kindness? And lastly, is happiness really a choice? Jason Lai discovers how nudges hold the power to tip the scales of our decision making while still leaving us with free choice. Through a slew of social experiments, we test if we can hack our hardwired brains to make better choices and nudge us in the right direction.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>
