Filmed in Venezuelas Gran Sabana mountains, Botswanas Okavango Delta, Romanias Carpathian Mountains, the Western Australia coast, and Borneos Brunei jungles, the five hourlong episodes see Stafford - a former British Army captain - attempt to last ten days in the harsh environments with nothing more than a camera.

Filmed in Venezuelas Gran Sabana mountains, Botswanas Okavango Delta, Romanias Carpathian Mountains, the Western Australia coast, and Borneos Brunei jungles, the five hourlong episodes see Stafford - a former British Army captain - attempt to last ten days in the harsh environments with nothing more than a camera. Viewers are provided a fly-on-the-wall perspective as Ed tries to find food, make fire, process water to drink, and build a shelter - among many other life-saving challenges.</desc></programme>
