Filmed in Venezuelas Gran Sabana mountains, Botswanas Okavango Delta, Romanias Carpathian Mountains, the Western Australia coast, and Borneos Brunei jungles, the five hourlong episodes see Stafford - a former British Army captain - attempt to last ten days in the harsh environments with nothing more than a camera.
