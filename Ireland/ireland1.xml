In 2016, Cara and Ben realised that in order to have the space they wanted theyd need to move out of the capital. Keen cyclist Ben discovered Bishops Stortford when he was out on a bike ride, and the couple moved into a rental property there so that they could get a feel for the town before they bought. With the surprise arrival of baby Max, and their rental lease about to end, they were desperate to buy a place of their own. Phil showed them just what they were looking for, and as fate would have it, just around the corner from their rental. Kirstie and Phil catch up with Cara and Ben to find that theyve expanded to a family of four and the house has had a serious makeover. In 2020, Tom and his Floridian wife Kaitlyn were still house sharing with Toms old schoolfriend in south London. Desperate to find their own pad to start a family in and even with a healthy budget of £450k, the couple had been struggling to find everything on their wish list: three bedrooms, character, lots of outside space for keen gardener Tom, and the American-style large open-plan living space that Kaitlyn was used to.

Now, Phils back to see how theyre getting on</desc></programme>
