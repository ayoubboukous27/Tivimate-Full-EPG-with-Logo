Born into a world of oppression in the cotton plantations outside Berclair, Mississippi, he went on to assemble his own band under the guidance of Millard Lee and found widespread popularity with his Singin the Blues album in the Elvis-charged swinging zeitgeist of 1956. His talent showed no bounds, and more than half a century later he released his 42nd studio album, One Kind Favor, by which time he was well into his eighties - and showing no sign of giving up. Filmed in locations across the States, as well as the United Kingdom, and featuring contributions by a range of fellow musicians including Eric Clapton, Bono, George Benson and Mick Hucknall.
