Its usually Sylvies job to help others feel calm, but now she needs to help herself. Katrina always gets worried when Sylvie is poorly, so next she needs to calm Katrinas nerves. The vet gives her the all-clear, but in the waiting room a little girl called Dina is very worried about her cat, Mittens, who has had an accident.

Parents, carers, and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! Giovanna has got a blue bib and blue sunglasses inside her bag. All the parents and babies have different blue toys and objects in their bags too, which are explored through play, songs and a story. Parents, carers, and their little ones at home are encouraged to hide a safe, baby-appropriate blue object or toy inside a fabric bag or pillowcase, and then play with the items together! The traditional nursery rhyme Little Boy Blue features, as does a story about Baby Bear and Baby Tiger dressing up in blue things, and viewers at home show how theyve been exploring the colour blue too. The Together Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with sensory scarves and the Goodbye Song.</desc></programme>

Having concluded their primary appeal is to caravanners, the duo spend a couple of days in models by Mazda and Volkswagen and try to get a feel for what life is like for the people they believe would buy one. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond drives a pair of exciting Lamborghinis in Italy - the ferocious Aventador Roadster and the limited-edition Sesto Elemento, which carries an eye-watering price tag of around £2million. Two cars are also put through their paces on the test track, with James in a modern re-creation of the classic Porsche 911 and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler in the rather less exotic Reasonably Priced Car</desc></programme>
