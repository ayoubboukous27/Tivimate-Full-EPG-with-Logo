This documentary series sees them embark on a mission to discover what aspects of modern life they are getting right but more often are getting wrong. Travelling the length and breadth of the UK behind the wheel of an electric car, Will and Ralf laugh, cry and learn more about themselves and each other in a few weeks than they ever have in two decades of friendship. Along the way, they meet a series of extraordinary characters, explore unexpected worlds, and push themselves well out of their comfort zones. Whether trying to impress the World’s Strongest Woman with their strength, talking to nettles in an eco-village, living like Stone Age cavemen or stripping naked in front of 1,000 women, Will and Ralf challenge themselves and each other to learn new things and to push themselves to do and be better. Along the way, stuck in the car for hours with only a satnav and a bespoke playlist to distract them, they bond not just through reminiscing about the good old days and indulging in in-car karaoke, but also through talking about where they are now as middle-aged men and opening up to each other</desc></programme>
