Rayane and Diesel have been practising with the metal detector in the garden. At the beach, Diesel helps Mum find the perfect spot for a picnic. Then Rayane and Diesel head off with their metal detector in search of some treasure. They find a harmonica, a spoon, some coins, a metal clip and then… a set of car keys. They head back up the beach to find Mum, and together they set off to reunite the missing car keys with their owner. Can Diesels super ears save the day again?</desc></programme>

Kirsties couple, Antoinette and Matt, have been renting in Southampton for three years, paying more than £30,000 in the process. They want their money to go into a home they own instead, but their search has been stalled by unsuccessful offers. Theyre looking for a four-bedroom house with a garden and a living room big enough for two televisions so the pair can enjoy their separate hobbies together. One particular property really hits the mark, but with other interested parties Kirstie must draw on her years of experience to ensure Antoinette and Matt arent pipped at the post yet again. Meanwhile, Phil is searching in and around charming Chichester with Catherine, who wants a fresh start following the end of her marriage. Three-bedrooms and a short commute to work are priorities, but that narrows the pool of potential properties. Phil tries a couple of curve balls, but ultimately location wins out over size and Catherine finds a house she thinks is the one</desc></programme>

In 2016, Cara and Ben realised that in order to have the space they wanted theyd need to move out of the capital. Keen cyclist Ben discovered Bishops Stortford when he was out on a bike ride, and the couple moved into a rental property there so that they could get a feel for the town before they bought. With the surprise arrival of baby Max, and their rental lease about to end, they were desperate to buy a place of their own. Phil showed them just what they were looking for, and as fate would have it, just around the corner from their rental. Kirstie and Phil catch up with Cara and Ben to find that theyve expanded to a family of four and the house has had a serious makeover. In 2020, Tom and his Floridian wife Kaitlyn were still house sharing with Toms old schoolfriend in south London. Desperate to find their own pad to start a family in and even with a healthy budget of £450k, the couple had been struggling to find everything on their wish list: three bedrooms, character, lots of outside space for keen gardener Tom, and the American-style large open-plan living space that Kaitlyn was used to. Even with Kirstie and Phil onside, none of the properties they saw hit enough of their marks to make the couple want to offer, so Phil advised them to expand their search area further east into Kent. Now, Phils back to see how theyre getting on</desc></programme>

This documentary series sees them embark on a mission to discover what aspects of modern life they are getting right but more often are getting wrong. Travelling the length and breadth of the UK behind the wheel of an electric car, Will and Ralf laugh, cry and learn more about themselves and each other in a few weeks than they ever have in two decades of friendship. Along the way, they meet a series of extraordinary characters, explore unexpected worlds, and push themselves well out of their comfort zones. Whether trying to impress the World’s Strongest Woman with their strength, talking to nettles in an eco-village, living like Stone Age cavemen or stripping naked in front of 1,000 women, Will and Ralf challenge themselves and each other to learn new things and to push themselves to do and be better. Along the way, stuck in the car for hours with only a satnav and a bespoke playlist to distract them, they bond not just through reminiscing about the good old days and indulging in in-car karaoke, but also through talking about where they are now as middle-aged men and opening up to each other</desc></programme>
