Parents, carers, and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! Giovanna has got a blue bib and blue sunglasses inside her bag. All the parents and babies have different blue toys and objects in their bags too, which are explored through play, songs and a story. Parents, carers, and their little ones at home are encouraged to hide a safe, baby-appropriate blue object or toy inside a fabric bag or pillowcase, and then play with the items together! The traditional nursery rhyme Little Boy Blue features, as does a story about Baby Bear and Baby Tiger dressing up in blue things, and viewers at home show how theyve been exploring the colour blue too. The Together Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with sensory scarves and the Goodbye Song.</desc></programme>
