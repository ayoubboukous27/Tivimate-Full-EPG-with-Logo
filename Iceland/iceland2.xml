Eddie has a list of jobs as long as his arm! Hodge really wants to help. Some fencing needs to be delivered, but the hooks that hold the tarpaulin down over the load are missing. As Eddie dashes off to yet another job, he asks Hodge to pick up some more hooks. Farmer Felix is anxious to get his fencing before his animals escape. Not realising he actually needs the hooks to keep the tarp secure, Hodge decides it would really help if he took the fencing with him on his way to pick them up. On his travels, the wind works the tarp loose. It affixes itself to Hodge, turning into a kind of sail.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.7.0</episode-num></programme>

Nevertheless, he also rarely ventures out in public, keeps quiet about his music, feels at home in the forests of Estonia and generates therewith – perhaps involuntarily – the impression of a recluse, which is attributed to him again and again: Arvo Part.The Estonian composer, who will celebrate his 90th birthday on September 11, 2025, verily exudes even solely by his appearance an aura of a mystic or an ascetic. He himself says: “I am no prophet, no cardinal, not a monk, not even a vegetarian.” But he is without a doubt a devout man, who has been a member of the Russian Orthodox Church since 1970, and under pressure from the Soviet apparatus of power was forced to leave his native Estonia in 1980. Via Vienna he arrived in Berlin, which for the next 30 years would become his second home and also the starting point for his international career.“The Lost Paradise” is the first international documentary about Arvo Part. It is quite an astonishment that such a shy artist has given his consent to be accompanied by a camera for an entire year: In his native Estonia, travelling to Germany, Italy, and Japan, where Part received the Praemium Imperiale, the world’s most prestigious award in the field of music, in October 2014.The film is framed by the identically named stage production “Adam’s Passion,” featuring three key works by Arvo Part, which American director Robert Wilson brought to the stage in May 2015 in a former submarine factory, the “Noblessner Foundry” in Tallinn.</desc></programme>

Sjálfur komst Edward út úr bílnum en stakk af og let ekki vita af slysinu næstu tíu tímana.

Edward neitaði ætíð að hafa verið undir áhrifum eða hafa átt í "osiðlegu" sambandi við Mary (hann var kvæntur) en gat aldrei útskýrt af hverju hann stakk af í stað þess að hringja á logreglu.
